    "# Simple card game IA\n",
    "\n",
    "We will describe in this notebook a very simple 2 players card game and a way to implement an IA to play this game using an **artificial neural network** (we will use a multi layer perceptron model)\n",
    "\n",
    "The IA will be trained only by playing, which means that no \"expert\" human player will implement strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only information about the game given to the IA is a function which indicates to the IA the cards allowed to play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The game\n",
    "The game is a very basic 2 player \"Trick-taking\" card game :\n",
    "\n",
    "### General description\n",
    "* There are 2 colors (color 0 and color 1)\n",
    "* Each color has N cards (valued from 0 to N-1)\n",
    "* The game is composed of N \"tricks\"\n",
    "* Player 0 starts to play for the first trick\n",
    "* The winner of a trick starts to play the next trick\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trick rules\n",
    "* The first player can play any card\n",
    "* If the second player has cards with the same color, ** he has to play the same color**\n",
    "* Otherwise he plays the other color\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trick winner\n",
    "* If the second player plays the same color. **The card with the highest value wins the trick**\n",
    "* If the second player does not have the same color. **The first player wins**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "* N = 3\n",
    "* We denote (1,0) card 1 of color 0\n",
    "* Player 0's hand = [(0, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1)]\n",
    "* Player 1's hand = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 1)]\n",
    " * Player 0 plays (2,0)\n",
    " * Player 1 plays (1,0)\n",
    "   * Player 0 wins the trick since 2 > 1 and start to play next trick\n",
    " * Player 0 plays (0,0)\n",
    " * Player 1 plays (0,1)\n",
    "   * Player 0 wins the trick since player 1 with no color 0, played color 1\n",
    " * Player 0 plays (1, 1)\n",
    " * Player 1 plays (2, 1)\n",
    "   * Player 1 wins the trick since 2 > 1\n",
    "* At the end of the game, player 0 wins 2 tricks, player 1 wins 1 trick\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategies comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare strategies, the players will play a twice :\n",
    "* Player 0 with hand 0, Player 1 with hand 1, Player 0 stats\n",
    "* Player 1 with hand 0, Player 0 with hand 1, Player 1 stats\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we compare both games :\n",
    "* If player 0 wins more tricks with hand 0 than player 1 with hand 0, player 0 wins the whole game\n",
    "* If player 1 wins more tricks with hand 0 than player 0 with hand 0, player 1 wins the whole game\n",
    "* Otherwise its draw\n",
    "\n",
    "## IA implementation\n",
    "We will implement a simple MLP model using keras library"
